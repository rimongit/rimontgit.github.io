But Donald was more interested in Manhattan. Over time the family sold most of the outer-borough holdings. The lone remaining asset from his father�s era is a 4% interest in Spring Creek Towers, a massive, 46-tower government subsidized housing complex with 5,881 units in Brooklyn�s East New York neighborhood that the�Trumps reportedly bought�into in 1973."

While valuations for San Francisco office space have dipped, the building has brought a higher net income, raising the value of Trump�s stake by $32 million."

While his Atlantic City casinos suffered through corporate bankruptcies, eventually reducing his stake to nothing, this joint venture with fellow real estate billionaire Phil Ruffin has become a premier destination by the Strip. It has 1,282 suites, more than half of which have been sold since it opened in 2008. It apparently has managed some of the properties for owners, renting them out."

Trump�s organization manages some of the hotels and resorts, including Trump Vancouver. Others, like India�s luxury condo Trump Tower, merely pay Trump to use his name. The highly lucrative business has enabled the Donald to spread his brand from the Philippines to Uruguay. While Trump has struck more licensing arrangements in the past year, FORBES cut the value of the portfolio after several sources suggested that the revenue from wholly owned properties like Doral Miami and Trump Las Vegas (disclosed in Federal Election Commission filings) should not be included in the valuation. FORBES already values those assets separately and thus this year subtracted their estimated revenues from the management business to avoid double counting."
